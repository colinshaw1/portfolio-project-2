--
For my Milestone project 2 for Code Institute Diploma in Software Development, I have chosen Project Example Idea 1. Build an interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. The goal of the game is the user want to play an online game that has elements of chance and provide a challanging game with increasing levels of difficulty to entertain online users. Potential features to be included are pattern matching functionality, limeted number of tries before the game is over, a score traing system, and the ability to play against the computer.
