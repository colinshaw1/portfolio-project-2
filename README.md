For my Milestone project 2 for Code Institute Diploma in Software Development, I have chosen Project Example Idea 1. Build an interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. The goal of the game is the user wants to play an online game that has elements of chance and provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to entertain online users.

What does the game do?

The game is a variant of the classic game Rock, paper and scissors generally used to decide something. In the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game you have two more options lizard and Spock. 

This game came from the show the Big Bang Theory and here are the rules explained by Sheldon "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
